# bin

This is a collection of scripts that are so essential
to my desktop enviroment that I place thim in $HOME/bin.
While I have not yet gone so far as to add this directory
to my PATH, this is largely because it's currently a bit
of a mess.

I've taken out the nuggets, sanitized them and included
them here for the greater good.

Enjoy.
